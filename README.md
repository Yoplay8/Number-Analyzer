# Abstract View
This program will take in a set of numbers. Multiple numbers can be put on the same line separated with spaces. The user can then select any row of numbers that they entered and compare them to see the frequeny of each number. All numbers are saved to a text file.

# Future Ideas
Im thinking I should have used regular expressions when separting the numbers with spaces because I noticed that if a user accidently enters in more that 1 space between numbers an error will occur.


# My Notes
I might consider taking out the green highlights as it doesn't seem to be as useful as I thought.

The right list seems to be confusing to the user as they might not completely understand why the
numbers are being sent from the left to right. Possibly with he middle list also. Add headers.

Get rid of the border lines in the middle list.

Organize arguments so they aren't all placed in sporadically.

I've noticed that the TF_Hold_Nums clears the input in the box not matter what. Maybe change that
because the user might get annoyed if the input keeps clearing and they accidently clicked out of the
box. Same the the TF_Range fields maybe do something about that. This is not a critical fix but
something to consider.

I never used XML but im starting to realize that XML has a huge advantage in that its easier to change file data.
